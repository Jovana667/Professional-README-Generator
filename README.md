# The professional README Generator

## Description

This command-line application was designed to streamline the process of creating a comprehensive README.md document. The generation of a professional README.md file is done through the collection of user inputs through a series of prompts. By automating this step of a project building process, developers can save time as well as ensuring a high quality README is always develivered on future projects.
